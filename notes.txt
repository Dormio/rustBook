1) Var logs has some very good files to look through.
- system.log seems to have a bit of everything. Look through here and figure
  out what we want to do. It's all plaintext.
- daily.log seems not to have very useful things inside of it. 
- weekly.log is a joke
- monthly.out seems to be fairly useless too.
- install.log has a list of what a lot of installs are going on. Could be worth
  further examination.


2) In /System/Library/LaunchDaemons there are tons of daemons. Keep of list of
those daemons and check at startup to see if they've changed.
